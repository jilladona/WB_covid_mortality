Data and do files (Stata) for replication of "Demographic Perspectives on the Mortality of Covid-19 and Other Epidemics""COVID-19 Age-Mortality Curves are Flatter in Developing Countries" available at http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/701441593610141326/pdf/COVID-19-Age-Mortality-Curves-Are-Flatter-in-Developing-Countries.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0PlOnCL_DPu48hE_d1HfIdJDy2DI7lPlFOYZYbVxSl-ZlI1jI_erWvo5I

The worksheet "Tables.xlsx" contains Tables included in the paper and other summary data. Do files to produce figures 1 and 2 take data from this worksheet. Other sheets in this file contain the outputs and tables shown in this paper.

The worksheet "Covid death rates by age and sex_06162020.xslx" contains one sheet per country containing population data by age and sex, and COVID-19 deaths by age and sex. Distinct sheets in the document summarizes the unnormalized and normalized COVID-19 mortality rates, respectively.

The worksheet contains sheets containing the data generated by "adjustment factor for age 80 plus.do" and "adjustment factor for age 80 plus by sex.do". These are used in the normalization of COVID-19 mortality rates per country.

The do files "covid-19 mortality rates.do" and "covid-19 mortality rates by sex.do" take data from the worksheet into a dataset. The datasets generated by the do files produce the next figures.

Figure 5. Mean Normalized COVID-19 Mortality Rates by Age Group and Country, High-Income vs Low- and Middle-Income Countries

The do file "rates of increase per year of age in covid-19 mortality rates.do" compute the rates of increase per year of age in COVID-19 mortality rate. The do file "rate of increase per year of age in all-cause mortality rate.do" compute the rates for all-cause mortality. The do files for the following figures are so named.
